# Coding Quiz

## Description 

This project is a code quiz to test JavaScript fundamentals. The project includes a start button that says "Begin Quiz" and also includes a timer. The project has a total of five questions with multiple choice answers and when answering incorrectly 10 seconds is deducted from the clock. The timer goes to zero when all questions are answered correctly or the timer reaches zero. The game also has a high scores list with initials to see which place each user is in.

## Usage

The user will select the "Begin Quiz" button which has a background color of blue and is in white text and the quiz will immediately begin. The user will then see a total of five questions appear and will have to answer the questions within 70 seconds. The user will then be prompted to submit their initials and the high score list will load.
